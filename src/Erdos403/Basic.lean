# Erdős Problem #403 — sums of distinct factorials that are powers of 2

**Problem (Burr–Erdős; [ErGr80, p.79]).** Does
`2^m = a₁! + a₂! + ⋯ + aₖ!` with `a₁ < a₂ < ⋯ < aₖ` have only finitely many solutions?

**Answer: yes** (Frankl and Shen Lin, independently, 1976 — both proofs *unpublished*;
Lin's was a Bell Labs internal memorandum, "On Two Problems of Erdős Concerning Sums of
Distinct Factorials"). The largest solution is `2⁷ = 2! + 3! + 5! = 128`.

Because the original proofs are lost to the literature, this is a **reconstruction**, not a
transcription. The final proof (in `Erdos403.Sharp`) works in the factorial number system: a sum of
distinct factorials is exactly a factorial-base numeral with all digits `≤ 1`, and for every
`m ≥ 8` both `2^m` and `2^m − 1` carry a digit `≥ 2` at some index `≤ 11` — a finite, fixed-modulus
(`12!`) check. Both `erdos_403_finite` and `erdos_403_sharp` are `sorry`-free and kernel-pure.

* This file: the core definition `factSum`, the extremal `witness`, and the size sandwich.
* `Erdos403.FactBase`: the factorial-number-system digit machinery.
* `Erdos403.Sharp`: the headline theorems.
* `Erdos403.Superseded`: an earlier, unused 2-adic valuation approach, preserved for the record.

A "sum of distinct factorials" is modelled by a `Finset ℕ` of indices (distinctness of the `aᵢ` is
automatic). Note `0! = 1! = 1`, so e.g. `{0,1}` sums to `2`.

/-! ## The size sandwich

For nonempty `S` with top element `M = max' S`: `M! ≤ factSum S ≤ 2·M!`. The lower bound (the top
factorial is one of the summands) is what the finiteness argument in `Erdos403.Sharp` uses. -/
